🌟 Day 4: Web Development Journey at Cognifyz Technologies 💻✨

Continuing my Web Development Internship, 
I successfully completed Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction – Step 4: Use Server-Side Rendering to Dynamically Generate HTML! 🎯
This step introduced me to the fundamentals of server-side rendering using EJS (Embedded JavaScript), helping me understand how to dynamically generate HTML content on the server.

🔥 Key Highlights
1️⃣ Setting Up EJS 🛠️
  Integrated EJS as the templating engine in my Express.js application.
  Configured the view engine to use EJS for rendering HTML templates.
2️⃣ Creating Dynamic Templates 📄
  Designed an EJS template to display a list of items dynamically.
  Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.
3️⃣ Rendering Data from Server 🚀
  Implemented server-side logic to pass data to the EJS template.
  Created a route to render the template with dynamic data.
4️⃣ Project Structure 📁
  Organized the project files with a proper .gitignore to exclude node_modules and environment files.
  Used npm scripts for running the development server.

🌱 Learning Outcomes 
✅ Strengthened my understanding of server-side rendering and dynamic HTML generation. 
✅ Explored EJS for creating reusable and dynamic templates. 
✅ Gained hands-on experience in integrating and using templating engines with Express.js.
